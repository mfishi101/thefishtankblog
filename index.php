			<p>This is just a page for me to put whatever is in my head down onto the internet. Because that seems safe right. Well I will try to keep everything as light-hearted as possible. </p>
			<p>All this page will be is a collection of things I have done and if i have any stories to share. I took up programming as a hobby and not a professional career as anyone worth their salt will know this is definitely amature work. If you have any ideas for my page then feel free to let me know as I absolutely love deleting junkmail in the evenings. It gives me great pleasure. </p>
