		<h2 class="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>This is my story of my journey and experience of having a pregnant wife and the scary realisation that I am going to become a dad. The events only happen from Week 5 as this was when we found out that I am going to become a dad.</p>
		<p>This will be recorded as the experiences happen. I like to call it 'The Chronicles of Baby Fish (I hope baby shark is now stuck in your head. It is going to be stuck in mine for a damn long time.)</p>

		<h3 class="weekLabel week5 hoverPointer trim1">Week 5</h3>
		    <div class="week5content content">
			<p>This is the first week of finding out that my wife is pregnant. I do not see how guys often say 'We are pregnant'. No... You are not pregnant. Your wife is pregnant and you are going to be hit with a quick realisation that mood swings are a very real and terrifying thing to experience.</p>
			<p> So the news has just dropped. You have so many things rushing through your head at once. Can this be true? Is this real? And there is a definite sense of excitement and terror all at the same time. Kind of like tickling your wife. It is all fun and giggles but at any moment you could get a foot to the jaw.</p>
			<p>The first thing that happened is I rushed home. We have never been the most lucky of people so we are still experiencing a bit of disbelief at this point. To put it in perspective, if there were 40 prizes and we were 41 people, then we would be the 1 who does not win.</p>
			<p>So time for the blood tests. We head over and get told that the results will only be available the next day unless a doctor puts a rush on it. Naturually I am on the phone immediately to book a doctor. My wife goes to the doctor and explains the scenario. The doctor gladly plays her part and phones. While the doctor waits for the results to come through, the doctor starts telling my wife a story. Mid story the results comes through. This is the moment of truth. The doctor reaches for the paper... Has a glance at the results... And then the damn doctor continues her story. </p>
			<p>Finally! It is now confirmed. My wife is 5 weeks pregnant. Now the fun part starts of who do we tell. Is it too early to start people? Who should know? Family only? Maybe some close friends?.. A lot of options. Well, my wife and I decided that we each get one person to tell outside of the parents. So naturally I chose my best friend and bestman from my wedding. My wife chose her best friend and colleague from school. </p>
			<p>So my wife and I are quite serious about sticking to the rules about who we tell. So naturally within the next day half her school knew... Told you we were serious.</p>
			</div>
		
        <h3 class="weekLabel week6 hoverPointer trim1">Week 6</h3>
			<div class="week6content content">
			<p>Week 6 got off to an interesting start. You always think that you will be a relaxed person and not stress about little things. I watch a lot of series and in those series when you see future dads wanting to run to the ER for every little incident, I laugh and say 'They are so dramatic'. Well, I now see it. My wife started having cramps and my mind obviously jumps to worst possible case. I was ready to jump in the car and make the Fast And Furious movies look like a children's show. It takes a friend to laugh at you to make you rethink it and just start regulating your breathing again. The cramps are not so severe anymore so at least now. It is amazing how slow time can feel when you are eagerly awaiting the first scan which apparently can only happen in week 8.</p>
			<p>I did not realise how many apps there are out there for pregnant women. That is great and all but I do not think they realise that there is a market for men living with pregnant women. These apps are amazing though. Every day you get a new update with how the unborn fetus is progressing. This tells you everything from comparing it to a peppercorn and to when the heart starts beating. The latest is that the head and brain is forming. That is quite a scary realisation and it makes you rethink how every day tasks now pose a threat. I find myself permanantly in NFL blockers stance ready to pounce. The worst is having a very energetic puppy at home. I am constantly running interference and making amazing tackles that would get me placed straight into the national rugby team.</p>
			<p>One thing that this new potential million dollar app for men should include is how to act around your pregnant wife. You think that once a month you deal with mood swings when they are not pregnant. Well I hate to break it to you, but that is nothing compared to a pregnant women. You tend to find yourself at the end of a lot of rants and comments that come with a lot of attitude. I am in a very fortunate situation however, that my wife realises this and it is not long till an apology comes. I hope that lasts because at the current trajectory I can see heavy objects flying at my head in the near future because of a miss-timed sarcastic comment or joke. This is a problem for me as I really do not think my comments and comebacks through before blurting it out and having that feeling of instant regret (and by regret I mean a very firmly clasped fist heading for my chest).</p>
			<p>All this being said, Week 6 has seemed to have gone off pretty well. </p>
			</div>
			
		<h3 class="weekLabel week7 hoverPointer trim1">Week 7</h3>
			<div class="week7content content">
			<p>I think everyone knows that having a child is expensive, but until you have a child on the way, that is the biggest understatement that a person can make. My wife went to a baby expo that was held which seems to be quite the rage amonst expecting moms as well as moms with toddlers. We are only in week 7 now and my bank account looks like a barren wasteland with no signs of life anywhere. </p>
			<p>Buying baby items is not as simple as just getting a pram and cot and off you go. There are so many things to take into consideration. How long does that pram last; does it convert into a car seat; do you have creams and oils for the baby(and cream for your wife's nipples which are going to apparently crack... oh joy). I feel like baby products should come with a test drive option, especially with the price that you pay for these items. It makes you want to contact a bank and ask if they do financing for babies. </p>
			<p>I have a piece of advice for expecting dads or anyone who is going to be an expecting dad: Do not! And I cannot stress this enough - do not assume that your wife is full during a meal. This poses a high risk of being stabbed and your life will flash before your eyes. At this point you just back away slowly and start to clean. No woman has ever fought with a guy while he was cleaning the dishes or cleaning the floor (unless you are doing a really horrible job, in which case, you better learn quickly).</p>
			<p>Overall not a bad week. I definitely think if a guy has survived 9 months of this then dodging landmines in a war ridden country is easy </p>
			</div>
			
		<h3 class="weekLabel week8 hoverPointer trim1">Week 8</h3>
			<div class="week8content content">
			    <p>Morning sickness is no joke. I did not know that such a tiny body could hold that amount of internal undigested fluids in it. At some point you would think it is just air. Morning sickness is such a misleading term. It should be called the deathly hallows sickness or something because it just comes out of nowhere and causes you to be shoved into a wall if you do not get out of the way in time. It is quite a sight to see your significant other in that state. One minute they are perfectly fine and it is almost as if you can visibily see the fluid moving up from the stomach and that sudden look of fear in her eyes as she grabs her mouth hoping that nothing spills out, pushing you aside with this sudden surge of strength as she paces for the bathroom. </p>
			    <p>On the positive side, at least my wife remembers where the bathroom is. I think all memory power is being syphoned by unborn fetus and leaving nothing left for the host. I am exaggerating for effect but many a truth told in jest. But out of everything that can happen during pregnancy (vomit everywhere for starters), I will gladly take having to repeat myself. Asking my wife to remember something is like asking a blind person to keep watch.</p>
			    <p>We finally had the first scan. It has felt like time was standing still for a while during this week. It is quite a scary expedition. You get called into the general office area and she first asks a series of questions. It felt like there was a wrong and right answer and if i give the wrong one that I will be judged harshly as a future dad. Still, nothing compares to actually hear that heartbeat, and then to be told that is coming from a being that is only 1cm long. </p>
			    <p>Now the wait happens till the next scan and watching the progress of how this tiny little baby fish grows.</p>
			</div>
			
		<h3 class="weekLabel week9 hoverPointer trim1">Week 9</h3>
			<div class="week9content content">
           
            <p>Week 9 got off to a great start. I had a puppy that was sick and decided to teach us what it is going to be like to have a child. The puppy started throwing up in the evening. We could see that this was not just from perhaps over eating or drinking too much water as it has been in the past. Our dog enjoyed gulping gallons of water as fast as that little tongue could move and then leaving us a nice pile of regurgitated water on the floor. Not realising that there is a 24/7 vet around the corner from our place, we proceeded to just try feed the dog and keep her comfortable till the vet opens in the morning. 
            </p>
            <p>The next morning comes and I woke up feeling ok. I did not sleep very well because I would constantly feel to make sure she is still alive. But the fact that puppy was still kicking was a good sign. I decided to make some coffee in the morning as per my usual ritual and then walk towards my bar area. Good grief... It looked like an extremely muddy landslide happened inside my house and we did not realise. The worst though was that smell. You get ready to enjoy your morning coffee and you get hit by this revolting smell that wakes you up better than any coffee been from Columbia could. 
            </p>
            <p>After arriving at the vet, I am told that she is not looking good and needs to be admitted to hospital. At the vet the poor puppy has be subjected to having a finger shoved up an area multiple times that day. If that news is not bad enough, I walk to the counter to get hit with the bill which is paid upfront. It felt like I was being hit with that familiar smell from the bar area again. And the same nausea sensation returning. 
            </p>
            <p>We were able to get the puppy back that same evening and given a complete breakdown of what needs to happen. This list ranges from constantly monitoring the puppy; force feeding horrible medicine; giving a diet of chicken and rice and the most fun part of keeping the puppy inside to be able to clean all poop straight away and to clean the puppy after each time the deed is done. 
            </p>
            <p>So, after feeling like a concerned parent for an entire week, I now realise that this is only a tiny taste of what is to come. I do not know whether to be excited, laugh, cry or have a nervous breakdown. But it is definitely going to be interesting.
            </p>

        <h3 class="weekLabel week10 hoverPointer trim1">Week 10</h3>
			<div class="week10content content">
           
            <p>Week 10 was not very eventful. We are now patiently awaiting the next scan to see how the baby is doing. At the moment it appears the baby is still busy rejecting most food types from my wife in the form of very violent projectile vomiting. </p>
            
            <p>Apparently I have become quite immune to the sounds of a wife getting sick in the middle of the night. I merely get told that there was an episode in the bathroom every half an hour and I did not even know about it. That is what happens when you work in an industry that participates in Black Friday. You tend to sleep through anything. That being said though, I still have a puppy that enjoys waking me up at 02:00 in the morning. 
            </p>
            <p>My puppy continues to try and give me lessons in what parenthood is going to be like. Once she wakes me up, I need to take her outside. After she has been outside, this seems to be her cue to get into the bed with us. Recently she has taken it upon herself to share my pillow. I wake up thinking that my wife is being affectionate with me by stroking my face, only to suddenly feel the claw scratching down my cheek. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Week 10 is ending with no real developments except for the fact that Baby fish is now supposed to be the size of a fig. We are now just eagerly awaiting the next scan to see the developments on the little one. If it takes after me, then it is going to be one big baby. </p>
       

			</div>
			
		<h3 class="weekLabel week11 hoverPointer trim1">Week 11</h3>
			<div class="week11content content">
           
               <p>Baby Fish is growing at some speed now. If the cramps and pains that my wife is experiencing is anything to go by, then this is going to be one giant baby. When I was born, I weighed in at a whopping 4.4kg. That probably explains why I am an only child. I like to think it is because they stopped after the hit the jackpot with me, but that probably is not the case (my poor mother). </p>
               
               <p>I am not sure if it is this pain that my wife is experiencing or the hormones that are just everywhere, but my wife goes through mood swings still at this stage. One moment I am the most amazing husband to step foot on this great green earth and the next it is visible in her expressions that just the sight of me annoys her. I am not sure whether to show love or just throw chocolates and run away. I don’t blame her. If she is indeed carrying a child that is anything close to my size in that tiny little body, then I definitely have a lot of sympathy for her.</p>
               
               <p>Luckily now we are only 1 week away from our next scan. At this point we do not know if we will be able to tell gender or not. And yes, I am referring to the predefined two genders. Whatever gender you believe you are, then good for you but I am wanting to see if there is a penis or not. There are so many opinions online and obviously everyone and their mother has another opinion about when you can actually find this out. I am not getting my hopes up, but it would be nice to find out already. Either way, I would like to know if I am purchasing condoms and teaching the way of life or I am purchasing a shotgun and 24/7 surveillance equipment. Obviously, that depends on the gender. </p>
               
               
               
            
       

			</div>
			
		<h3 class="weekLabel week12 hoverPointer trim1">Week 12</h3>
			<div class="week12content content">
           
               <p>The scan finally arrived. We were all excited and hoping the baby is going to play along and reveal the gender to us. The rug was swept out from under us when we found out that we had this scan 4 days too early to determine the gender. The overall scan went really well. You get so nervous in the room as the doctor analyses every corner of your unborn child. I start acting like a psychology expert. I look at every facial expression and every movement in the body language of the doctor to see the reactions and wonder if at any moment the doctor is going to tell us there is something wrong.  </p>
               
               <p>The stress was all for nothing, as the baby is healthy, and everything is where it must be at this point with the baby measuring in at a whopping 5cm. It appears much larger on the screen and then it sinks in that this little being is only 5cm. The heart is beating, but it is the size of a grain of rice. The session is very informative. Apparently, the brain only develops at 18 weeks. So, at this point the baby only has the basic reflexes and instincts, no cognitive thinking, which, judging by some people I know, is probably more than they possess in their adult lives.</p>
               
               <p>The weekend leading up to the scan kept me on my toes. My wife could not keep anything down, and that includes water. She was in bed from the Friday straight through till Sunday. When I looked at my wife in this state, all I could think is what am I going to see on this scan. Is she housing some alien species sent to destroy the internal organs of my wife. On a positive note, when someone is that sick then they cannot delegate chores to be done. You cannot talk if fluids are blocking those vocal cords (I am definitely going to pay for this once my wife reads it).  </p>
               
               <p>At least everything ended well with the scan and my wife can soon relax as the teachers start the holidays soon. Well I say relax but my sister in law is coming to visit which means my wife is going to go into cleaning mode. So, I will have to see what week 13 has in store for me. </p>
               
               
               
            
       

			</div>
			
		<h3 class="weekLabel week13 hoverPointer trim1">Week 13</h3>
			<div class="week13content content">
           
               <p>The week finally arrived. We now can most definitely find out the gender of our unborn fetus. My wife and her friend went to the specialist to have the scan done. The friend was with just to make sure my wife did not try to get a look at the gender without me. The gender was to be revealed to us via a gender reveal method of the friend's choosing. What a day leading up to the reveal. I looked at the time to see that it was still 11am. I did all the work I had, had some food, took a stroll around town all to kill sometime and make the day go by faster. I look at the time... 11:05am. Really now.</p>
               <p>Once I arrived home, we could finally get the proceedings underway. There were 3 balloons floating around and champagne glasses that were waiting to be filled once we found out (non-alcoholic for my wife of course). The family also wanted to be part of this event but due to geographic restrictions we needed to make another plan. In the end there were 4 phones being held by two people so that everyone could be on a video call and part of the action. 
                </p>
               <p>The first two balloons were filled with just black and white confetti. Most likely there to annoy my wife with the cleaning that would have to happen afterwards. Third balloons pops after my failed attempt in trying to pop it over my wife's head. IT'S A BOY. We are having a little baby boy and apparently there was no doubt that he was a boy when the scan was done. He must definitely take after his father (cough cough). 
                </p>
               <p>Finding out the gender was great except for what it is doing to my bank balance. Have you ever tried to tell a hormonal pregnant wife not to spend money? We came to an agreement. No big items till later in an effort to save money. My wife took this to mean that she can buy smaller items that added together have the same effect. It is now Christmas and festivities are high, so I will let this one be. It is going to be one very long January.
                </p>

		<h2 class="trimester2 hoverPointer trimesterheader">2nd Trimester</h2>
			
		<h3 class="weekLabel week14 hoverPointer trim2">Week 14</h3>
			<div class="week14content content">
           
               <p>All the articles you read and all the doctors opinions out there state that nausea and morning sickness should go away after the first trimester. Apparently, my wife enjoys being above average. If it is not my wife, then it is my baby boy inside of her that is in this for the long haul. It seems quite heartless, but you get to a point where you see your wife running for the bathroom, hoping she will make it in time, and you just continue eating your dinner and turning up the volume on the television. I know that I most likely will not be competing in 'husband of the year', but in all honesty, there is not much you can do. You wait it out and if she manages to hold anything down then you give her some toast, pat her on the head and say, 'There there, it will be ok'.
                </p>
               <p>I cannot express the joy I feel that I am fortunate enough to be staying in a house with a swimming pool. It is not actually for my use but for my wife's use. It sometimes appears that she is hosting a ball of flame that is burning her up from the inside. At least with us having a pool, it means that she has some opportunities to cool off in the hot weather. And that gives me the opportunity to catch up on some series. And by catch up some series, I mean try and nap and then catch up on some gaming time. After the amount of time and money I put into this pool, I would sure hope that it gets used to the maximum. 
                </p>
               <p>After these three months there has been some changes to the body, especially some weight gain. And then there are the changes that my wife experiences. One piece of advice that I have for gents who have an overly excited pregnant wife is, do not treat the changes in the body the same as that of before the pregnancy. If they ask if that butt is getting bigger then you say it is looking better each day. Pregnant ladies who want to be pregnant actually want to see the changes and get excited for the changes. It is like when a boy going through puberty starts to grow hair. It is a very exciting moment.
                </p>
               <p>Now we can head into the new year with the exciting prospect that this year will be the year that our child is born.
                </p>

		<h3 class="weekLabel week15 hoverPointer trim2">Week 15</h3>
			<div class="week15content content">
           
              <p>I managed to take some leave from work for this week to relax and recover from a busy festive season. What I had in mind was a nice peaceful time on the couch, watching the cricket and having a drink. What my wife had in mind was now that I have the time, it was an opportunity for me to clean the yard and do the house work. I even did some cooking because my wife got quite sick again. I honestly do not know how there is anything still left in that body. A person would think that when someone is that sick that they would just keep to themselves and have no energy for anything. But in the middle of getting sick she still has time to lift her head and ask why the coke bottle is still on the table. Her priorities are a little out of sync.
                </p>
            <p>Our child probably can be born today already, and we will be set with clothes for the next month. I need to buy a pair of blinkers for my wife when she enters a shop else we will end up being the proud owners of half the baby aisle. The latest addition was batman pajamas. Many people have said that once there is a child then you will have no more money anymore because it all goes to your little one. Well that starts before the child is even born. At this rate, the end of the month salty cracks is looking like a luxury item that I will never be able to afford.
            </p>
            <p>There seems to be a gadget for everything you could require to raise an infant. The one most recent is a device that keeps the bottles at an exact temperature so that you can just get up and feed the baby. With all the gadgets that I have been seeing, it is making me increasingly nervous as it is giving me a feeling that I am extremely unprepared for this. I have had the image in my head that you feed, burp and rock the baby, and then when they are old enough, they do chores and you relax with a nice cold beer. I am in for a surprise. 
            </p>
            <p>With week 16 approaching, the biggest accomplishment I can hope for is that the morning sickness ends now. I want to say it is for my wife's sake but, honestly, it is for my own sanity as well.
            </p>

			<h3 class="weekLabel week16 hoverPointer trim2">Week 16</h3>
			<div class="week16content content">
           
            <p>            I have always heard stories about all the weird and wonderful things that wives make their husbands do while pregnant. I have been fortunate enough to not have to get up at 2am in the morning and go buy anchovies and jam or anything in that class of weird craving. In fact, I have actually been allowed to sleep (besides a puppy that wakes me up to go outside). 
			</p>
            <p>I have been slowly progressing through the tasks that have been bestowed upon me, ranging from tying shoelaces because my wife cannot reach her feet on some days, to having to become pedicure expert by painting toe nails. When you have never painted toe nails before then this becomes quite the challenge. My wife's toes ended up getting more nail polish on it that the actual nail itself. But I guess going forward I am going to have to do this more often, so I am sure that I will be qualified to do this for a living before this pregnancy is over. I do think that tying the shoes was taking a bit of a chance, but I am not one to argue with a pregnant woman. I still get nervous twitches whenever she picks up a sharp object.  
			</p>
            <p>Nothing, and I repeat, nothing comes close to being asked to examine parts of your wife that you have not really examined in that much detail before. It can be quite a daunting task. Try taking a sip of your morning coffee while being randomly asked to inspect the size of your wife's nipple. The table in front of me nearly received a nice stained finish from second hand coffee. Now, when asked if it looks any different, there is most definitely a right answer to this. Once I actually find out the right answer then I will let you know as I seem to still have it wrong. 
			</p>
            <p>I promised my wife I would not speak about this, but I feel it should be said as the entire point of this is to share everything that happens and what guys can expect. I was asked something that I never expected to be asked. I was asked to shave my wife. when I say shave, I am not referring to under her arms. Oh, how I would have taken that in a heartbeat. I had to stare straight down my son's future doorway and shave. This is the most nerve wrecking thing you can do. You do not want to make a single mistake or slip of the hand. I felt like I was a doctor doing brain surgery and it was a case of life and death. Also, do not use this time to try and negotiate all the things you want as you need to keep in mind that this is going to end at some point and she will not forget that you tried to hold her hostage in the hopes of getting a new Xbox game. 
			</p>
            <p>Apart from conducting minor surgery the week went well. The morning sickness appears to be reaching the end. Hopefully all is going well with the fetus leading up to the next scan in 2 weeks’ time.

			<h3 class="weekLabel week17 hoverPointer trim2">Week 17</h3>
			<div class="week17content content">
				<p>My wife has never had the best memory in the world. Asking her to remind you of something is as good as asking the puppy not to pee when you walk in the house. You are not going to get the desired result. However, I feel that my wife has put a new spin on the term 'pregnancy brain'. Not only will she forget to remind me of what I needed her to remind of later, she will forget what she asked me. You reach a point when you have been asked the same question three times that you just accept it and answer it again. The problem with this is that it becomes extremely difficult to keep the sarcasm at bay when answering the question for the third time. 
				</p>
				<p>Where the memory is lacking, I feel that other parts of her have now been heightened. When asked to do something that I do not particularly enjoy, I attempt to keep my dissatisfaction to myself and get on with the task. This being said, it does not stop the occasional eye roll or letting out a little sigh. I could be in another continent and my wife will physically hear the eyes in their sockets rolling and call me out on it. How she does that is a mystery. Perhaps she is just taking an educated guess that I am not really in the mood to do these tasks. I cannot wait for the day that our child will be big enough to delegate these wonderful tasks. I will be so heartbroken to not take out the trash or clean the pool just to mention a few. 
				</p>
				<p>My wife and I rarely call each other. We live on voicenotes over WhatsApp. We find with our work schedules and requirements it just makes sense to leave a voicenote and the other one can listen to it whenever they get a moment. That all being said, when the one phones the other then you always first get a sinking feeling because this could now be an emergency. With a child on the way it will cause you mind to run over the mountain and back with all the possible things that could be wrong before you have even answered the phone. So, when my wife called me, naturally my heart did a few backflips before I answered. My wife had some pressure in nether region of her body. She was scheduled in same day to go to the doctor to just make sure everything is still where it must be. Fortunately, it was just the baby sitting quite low. And the fact that they are now 2 weeks ahead of schedule in terms of weight also did not help the pressure. 
				</p>
				<p>My child is clearly wanting to beat my weight at birth. He is not even born yet and already has a 'dad-bod' just like his father is busy getting in full force. At least we got peace of mind that the fetus is still healthy and kicking. (Kicking my wife into a few mood swings).

			<p>When you go to the doctor for the first scan, they tell you all about how nicely the baby is protected; where the cushioning is and; certain signs. You can listen to it and think you can feel comfort knowing that the baby is going to be all good. My wife slipped and fell the in the week. Not a very serious fall. She fell and mostly just scraped her leg. I always considered myself a very caring and protective husband. So, when she falls, I will be there to make sure she is still fine and then cater to her needs to just make sure that she is good. Once there is a child present, it is only then that you realise that your wife takes a backseat. My first thought jumps straight to how the baby is doing. I was not even phased by the picture of the scraped knee I received. I just wanted to know that baby was still kicking.
			</p>
			<p>I learnt a new trait about myself through the whole process. I can be quite excessive and perhaps perceived as annoying (so my wife points out, but the jury is still out there). After the fall I go into panic mode. It must have been every 20 minutes for two days straight that I kept asking if my wife can feel the baby and if anything feels off. I hope she sees that caring but what she does not realise is that I had my car keys already in hand ready to make the 'Fast and Furious' drivers look like amateurs. The only saving grace is that we have another scan in week 19 and I will do my best to hold out.
			</p>	
			<p>We are now reaching the half way mark and that feeling of being a dad has not quite kicked in. Do not get me wrong though, the instincts are still there, but I do not think the idea of there will permanently be a little being in the house that is part of my own DNA. The realisation better kick in quickly because the time is going to go by quicker than what I realise.

			<p>When there is a child on the way then it is normal for priorities to change. The one thing that I forgot is that applies to my wife and not only me. I was given the duty of getting our dinner prepped and ready to go into the slow cooker. This task included peeling potatoes, cutting up the vegetables and the meat and placing it in the cooker. It takes a special kind of person to end up cutting themselves with a potato peeler on the first potato. Well, I am that special person. 
			</p>	
			<p>I managed to cut myself with the potato peeler after not even being halfway done with the first potato. Now I know that this seems like something that a person would do to get out of having to complete the tasks, and knowing me, it would be a fair assumption to make. But, this was not the case. After I cut myself (and made it seem like I was just stabbed), I started to run my finger under the tap and called my wife to come to my aid as any self-respecting grown man would do. She immediately is on top of it and heads off to the bedroom to get a plaster for her wounded husband. 
			</p>
			<p>This task should only take a couple seconds as the plasters are in the top drawer and quite visible. This tasked seems to be taking my wife longer than what it should be. In the meantime, I am standing holding my finger under the tap. I call out to my wife only to find out the baby was pressing on her bladder and she decided she needed to make a pitstop first. Clearly priorities have shifted for her as well. I cannot exactly blame my wife though. I think that once the baby is born, I will even use my wife as a human shield to protect the child.

           <p>Another scan done and dusted. I always thought that the scans would just be the same thing over and over. I did not understand the need for me to go to each scan and before my wife was pregnant, I was one of those people who thought I would probably just go to the first one and then just one or two more in-between. That was a big error in judgement on my part. 
			</p>
           <p>I think I am probably more excited (probably nervous, but I want to think it is excitement) than my wife for the next scan. It is not that anything significantly different happens in the scans. With everything that happens during those periods between scans, it just comes as a relief to be able to go to the doctor and still hear that the heart is beating and everything is still normal with baby.  
			</p>
           <p>I still have no idea what I am looking at on these scans, but the most important for me is to just hear a heartbeat. My wife was showing me the picture of the scan afterwards and telling me how the features look like. I had to ask which way was the baby facing. After she told me which way the baby was facing, I then had to follow up by asking where the actual head was. Those pictures really are not clear to someone if you have no idea what you are looking at. I think my wife is just faking it but I will let her have that one.

            <p>My wife has never had the best immune system in the world. That is the biggest understatement so far. My wife could probably catch a cold from someone 2 continents over. I do not think we have ever had a positive savings balance with the medical aid. The doctors probably keep her file on their desk because they are going to damage the draws in the office from opening it too much. 
			</p>
           <p>The problem now comes in with her being pregnant. Not only does it lower her immune system further (I did not think this was at all possible), but it also means there is absolutely nothing that she can take for whatever virus she picks up. The best the doctor can give her is bed rest and some Panados. Panados can really not be considered pain relief in any way. I can take 10 right now and still get more pain relief from a Smartie. 
			</p>
           <p>One of the great things about my wife being sick at home, means that she now has the opportunity to look at the house and make a nice long list of chores for me to do. I do love doing chores after a long day at work. In case it was not clear, that was all sarcasm. As much as I might complain about having to do a lot more in the house, I would be even more unhappy with my wife doing it. I would rather just take the hit and not have anything happen to the baby. </p>

           <p>This week did not bring up anything particularly interesting, but hey, not every week can be a great adventure, especially when I am sick and off work for two days. What I did learn is that i am not necessarily the most paranoid person in this pregnancy.
			</p>
           <p>My wife slipped and almost fell. but it is that kind of moment where the one leg just slips out in front of the other but not enough to actually create a fall. It is just enough for the body to have this jerk reaction and a sudden shock. There was enough of a shock that my wife thought that she is going into premature labour. It took me to calm her down. And Let us face it. I am not the calmest person as can be seen by the journey thus far. The wine definitely helped keep me calm. Nothing could phase me in that moment.
			</p>
           <p>I try to step in for my wife and do all the tasks that she would do so that she can take it easy and not put strain on her. I do find this a tough task when she can be quite OCD about a clean house. I think she wants the house to look like people do not live there. To be honest, that is the only way it will get to that level. The house would be merely a show house. I cannot wait till the child is here to see how she reacts to the house then. There is going to be toys everywhere and poop in places that poop has never been before.

           <p>We had another in depth scan. The scan where you can see a lot more detail. The kind of scan that even I can see the baby and it does not just look like a blob on the screen. The normal scans are really difficult for me to identify. My mother-in-law said that the child looks a lot like my wife in the profile. I took a look again and picture and had to ask which way the baby was facing. And then I had to ask where the head actually is. At least with this in depth scan I can now start to see where the head is. 
			</p>
           <p>The scan showed that we are on track quite nicely. In fact, the baby is now growing ahead in some areas. The biggest area is the stomach. I knew that this baby will take after me. I am growing my stomach and above normal levels as well. So, once we got home my wife decided to celebrate a healthy yet slightly chubby baby by making pancakes. That seems like a good way to help all our waistlines. 
			</p>
           <p>My wife makes us go into every store that we pass that contains baby goods. At the rate that this baby is growing, I think that this child is going to be born straight into toddler phase. There is so much stuff that we still need to get before the baby comes though. I at least have one card to play when my wife starts looking at all these items in the stores. We have not had a baby shower for my wife yet. So, I keep getting to play the card that we do not know what we are going to get from that. Once the baby shower is done, I am going to be screwed. I will need a new excuse.</p>

          <p>There is a moment during the pregnancy where you might look calm on the outside, but on the inside, you are screaming like a 10 year old girl who just witnessed a horrific act. It is the most normal process to happen, however it still comes as a shock to witness it, especially this early still. My wife was complaining about her nipple being itchy. Upon close examination a thick white substance started to come out. As normal as this process is, it still was a very weird sensation to see. 
			</p>
          <p>My wife has a very similar sense of humor to me, and this is probably why we get along so well. My concern with her being a lot like me is that I worried she is going to try con me into drinking something and it will be breast milk. At least for that I still have a while before it becomes and actual concern. I am sure I am going to start having nightmares about that though. 
			</p>
          <p>My wife had some severe pains and went to the doctor to just have it looked at. The next thing, I casually receive a message from my wife saying she is being admitted. That is not something to just casually type in a message without any further explanation. She was booked in for observation for the night just to monitor The pain. Everything else seemed to be good for now. Apparently, the baby is growing too quickly for her little body to adjust. She should have planned this better before deciding to marry me. If I was anything to go by then she is still in for a lot more.

				<p>I seem to be competing with my wife on who has the biggest belly. I have never weighed this much in my life. I like to think it is the sympathy weight that I am gaining or even better, the dad bod that I am gaining. You know it is happening when pants that could be worn a few months ago, now do not even close. They are just a placeholder in my cupboard at this point. A reminder of who I used to be.
				</p>
				<p>While my wife continues to grow, the pain does not seem to be as bad. Or she is just learning to live with it. She lives with me. If she can survive my quirks, then I am sure she will be fine in this pregnancy. We had another scan and it looks like our baby has now come back to normal size and growth, and not this massive child that it was a concern for us at one point. 
				</p>
				<p>The scan is always a fun and relieving part. We get to hear that the heart is still beating and that everything is still going smoothly. The part that is not as fun is when you get that picture they give you after every scan. That blob that is supposed to be your child but unless you have a medical degree, you cannot see what you are looking at. When I finally managed to see what I was looking at, it gave me such a fright that I felt like I needed to lock the doors. The doctor managed to get that photo at a really bad angle that it made the eye sockets appear to just be these two black holes. Something that I am sure inspired most of Stephen King's writing. 
				</p>
				<p>The scans are now starting to get more frequent. We shall see what the next one holds in store for us.

				<p>My wife was away this week. So naturally I kept the house in tip top shape. I did not run out of dishes to use and have a sink full with no space left. I did not have to wash a dish as needed. I must admit that even I was a little ashamed at the condition of the place. It was my little rebellion stage while home alone.
</p>
				<p>My puppy decided this was a perfect time to give me a new lesson in parenthood. When I looked at my puppy coming running for me with that excitement in her then my heart just fills with joy. She jumps up onto me, and she starts licking my face. It was that moment where she paused, gazed into my eyes, and relieved the contents of her stomach all over my shirt. It is that time where you cannot react harshly as you know it is not her fault. I just had to clean myself up and move on from there. 
</p>
				<p>Fortunately, we had a public holiday the day before my wife came home. Gave me a chance to do some cleaning before my wife arrived. When I say some cleaning, I mean a full overhaul of the house after leaving it in my care for one week.

				<p>My wife and I live in a different city to that of our in-laws. We however grew up there and did our schooling there before moving to where we live now. That means that we have network of people that we know and are friends with in both cities. My wife was fortunate enough to get two baby showers for this very reason. I am not complaining because that meant more gifts. With the prices of everything these days, this is a most welcomed tradition to follow. 
				</p>
				<p>The gifts that you get are sometimes very traditional that even I know it is required. But then there are items that you require so much of that I was very shocked. I did not know that a woman would need that many pads and babies need that many diapers. Our cupboard is full of nappies and that will probably last 2 weeks. You would think that all the baby does is cry and poop. 
				</p>
				<p>The other tradition which I was happy about is one for the guys called a diaper party. This is where the guys that come all need to bring nappies. Also, a much needed commodity once the baby is born, and if I have to think of everything we still need then I might be needing one of those diapers for myself.

				<p>Having gone through several weeks of this pregnancy, you tend to think you have heard and seen it all. You tend to think that there is nothing more that your wife could throw at you that will surprise you. That was wishful thinking. After receiving all the gifts from the baby showers and having gone through it, among those items were two different styles of baby bottles. Now I never knew that you could get so many different kinds and different shapes. 
				</p>
				<p>Apparently with bottles, there are many different nozzles on the top and that babies could actually have a preference. My wife walks up to me and looks me dead in the eye. Here I am expecting her to show me the differences and educate me on the types of bottles. She looks at me and asks, "So which one of these nozzles looks most like my nipple?". 
				</p>
				<p>This was a normal question for her. There are concerns about child birth that I have not even considered yet. There is a concern that your baby does not latch onto the mother's nipple and therefore, breast feeding is no longer an option. This means that the baby will be using bottles. That being said, they can at some point learn to latch and therefore my wife asked the valid question. The mother wants to get something which is closest to the shape in order to get the baby used to it.

				It has been a while since I updated the site. My wife was worried that it was because I was losing interest. I tried to explain to her that as much as she is in her last trimester, I am living with someone in their last trimester. Needless to say, I nearly thought I was going to have to make myself comfortable on the couch. </p>
				<p>
				The last trimester goes past so quickly, and it is all such a blur. The check-up scans become more frequent, more irritability, less social life, more irritability, getting all the last items you need, and lastly and I cannot stress this enough, more irritability.</p>
				<p>
				When you start the final trimester then your stress levels reach new heights. It suddenly kicks in that you are in the final stretch and that this is real. It is not just your wife that is picking up some weight (note to self: Do NOT joke with your wife about picking up weight). But from this moment on it becomes a bit of a blur. The weeks start ticking over quickly.</p>
				<p>
				There was a lot of last-minute shopping that happened to make sure that we have everything for the baby. We even bought some maybe not so needed items. That might have in fact been my doing. I know I am going to be that dad that buys things for his child, but it is actually things that I would like to secretly have and play with. At least now I won’t be the creepy guy playing with it but instead the great father who is spending time with his son. </p>
				<p>
				As first-time parents the last trimester is the scariest of all the trimesters. You finally in a stage where you have to actually start monitoring for signs that your wife may be going into labour or early labour if it happens earlier in the pregnancy. My wife ended up going in 3 times in one month all because we did not know what to expect and we were not sure if the symptoms were false labour or actual labour.</p>
				<p>
				False labour is the most terrible thing to ever have existed. It messes with your stress levels. Is your wife having actual contractions or are they false labour signs? Who knows! We were at that maternity ward so much that we started feeling like locals. You get to know all the nurses there and they get to know you. </p>
				<p>
				Fortunately, one of the 3 times my wife had actually gone in. I was sitting at work when she said that she is going to go in again, for the third time. So, naturally I was not really phased and did not rush over. I told her to let me know if there is anything. Boy did I look like a tit after that. As it turned out, my wife was 2cm dilated and deemed to be in preterm labour. </p>
				<p>
				When someone goes into preterm labour then they attempt to suppress the labour to try and make sure that the lady makes it to term so that it can be the safest for the baby. That stay caused her to have to stay in the hospital for 4 days. Needless to say, I could not concentrate at work. But it did give me the perfect excuse to leave early and go and visit. Fortunately, whatever the doctors did worked and they managed to keep the baby in a while longer. </p>
				<p>
				After you reach what they deem full term (37 weeks) then you kind of just hope for it to happen now because the most horrible feeling is being at work and every time your phone just makes the slightest of movements then your heart rate rises wondering if this is going to be the phone call to tell you that it is finally happening. </p>
				<p>
				Apparently having intimate relations helps stimulate the area and can cause a lady to go into labour. Now I am all for getting down to business, but that, that is the scariest thing ever. I know this makes me sound like a horrible human and husband, but it is a scary notion. All you can think about is what if the baby's head is facing down and you end up poking your child into a deformity. </p>
				<p>
				Well needless to say, it took 37 weeks and 3 days and our little baby boy was born. He weighed in at 3kg and 51cm long. </p>
				<p>
				You can hear stories and see things on television, but nothing prepares you for that labour room when the time actually arrives. My wife made me promise not to look down 'there' while it was happening for the concern that I might never be able to look at her the same way again. I recommend this to all dads in the room. I spent zero time in the lower half of her body during the labour and what I still say haunts me. They show you the sack that the baby was in afterwards. How my child is not an alien, I have no idea. </p>
				<p>
				The scariest moment is when the doctor says that the baby is coming out on the next push. My wife gives one last push and I just keep lifting her head up for the support. Baby comes out and the doctor just throws the baby down onto my wife's stomach. I nearly wanted to drop kick that doctor out the room. Baby is not even seconds old and I get a mini heart attack from what felt like my son being flung around and onto the stomach. </p>
				<p>
				That ends my trials of what to expect for expecting dads. It was an interesting journey. My wife is already talking about the next one, but I think I need some time for my blood pressure to recover after this one! </p>
